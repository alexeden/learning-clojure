- `#'ns/` is the literal representation for a var, `ns` is the namespace
- `user` is the default namespace
- `defn` is a combination of `def` and `fn`
    - `fn` defines the function
    - `def` binds it to a name
- List constructors `'(1 2 3)` are prefixed with an apostrophe because parenthesis are otherwise considered function invocation
- Lists are NOT indexed (unlike vector)
- Order is not preserved when adding elements to a list using `conj`
- `into` returns a collection of the same type as its first argument
- Commas are treated as whitespace
- Records are an alternative to maps; they generally have better performance and have a named "typed" which can be used for polymorphism
- All values logically evaluate to `true` or `false`
    - The only false values are `false` and `nil`
- `when` returns `nil` if the conditional is not met
- Clojure provides recur and the sequence abstraction
    - `recur` is "classic" recursion
        - Consumers donâ€™t control it, considered a lower-level facility
    - Sequences represent iteration as values
        - Consumers can partially iterate
    - Reducers represent iteration as function composition
- Core functions that operate on sequences expect the sequence as their last argument
    - So, pipelines containing `map`, `filter`, `remove`, `reduce`, `into`, etc usually call for the `->>` macro
- Core functions that operate on data structures expect the value they work on as their first argument
    - So, pipelines containing `assoc`, `update`, `dissoc`, `get` and their `-in` variants to transform maps using these functions often require the `->` macro
