- `#'ns/` is the literal representation for a var, `ns` is the namespace
- `user` is the default namespace
- `defn` is a combination of `def` and `fn`
    - `fn` defines the function
    - `def` binds it to a name
- List constructors `'(1 2 3)` are prefixed with an apostrophe because parenthesis are otherwise considered function invocation
- Lists are NOT indexed (unlike vector)
- Order is not preserved when adding elements to a list using `conj`
- `into` returns a collection of the same type as its first argument
- Commas are treated as whitespace
